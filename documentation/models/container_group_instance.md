Used to track deployment and update progress across the container group fleet.                                                                                  |

If no readiness probe is defined, this will be true once the instance is fully started. |
| Started      | bool                                           | ❌       | Indicates whether the container group instance has successfully completed its startup sequence and passed any configured startup probes. This will always be true when no startup probe is defined for the container group.                       |
| DeletionCost | int64                                          | ❌       | The cost of deleting the container group instance                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
